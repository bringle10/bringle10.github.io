            <h4> <br> <br> Let me introduce myself!
                Currently, I am a student at NAIT enrolled in my second year of Computer Engineering. I grew up on a farm where nature is usually the only disturbance to the quiet. 
                <br> Moving to the city was a little bit of an adjustment in the amount of people in a much smaller space and the sounds from automobile traffic. 
                <br> 
                On the upside though, the city does offer a wide range of opportunities to try new things and meet new people. I enjoy being able to go to the local recreation centre. 
                <br> During my school years I enjoyed curling and played competitively on a league where we were very successful. I volunteered at my local curling rink to coach the new curlers in a program called Little Rocks. <br> They learned the basics of curling such as throwing and sweeping and gradually also the strategies that make curling such an exciting game. 
                <br> My approach to life is simple, say yes to opportunities and learn from each and every one.</h4>
